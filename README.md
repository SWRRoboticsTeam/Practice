# SWRRobotics Team Practice Repo (49627A)
This repository is dedicated to the development of the Shoreham-Wading River Robotics Team RobotC code.

## Adhering To Gitflow
Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

### MASTER BRANCH

The master branch stores the official release history tied to a version. Pull requests can only be accepted by a lead developer.

### DEVELOP BRANCH

The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. Individual developer code should be branched from master but always pushed to develop. Branches should follow the naming convention {FirstInitial}{LastName}-{Feature#/name} (Ex. NVERTUCCI-Feature1 or NVERTUCCI-TerminatorBot).

**Currently Active Branches** ([can be viewed here](https://github.com/SWRRoboticsTeam/Practice/branches))

1. NVERTUCCI-TerminatorBot (Mr.V's Test Code for TerminatorBot)
